# Software manual for Knowledge Exploration System DES

Welcome to DES, the knowledge exploration system used as the basis for several knowledgebases:

- [DES tomato](http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/des_tomato) (2017)
- [DES mutation](http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/des-mutation) (2018)
- [DES redox](https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/des-rv) (2019)

The knowledge exploration system consists of information
organized in a way that allows easy information retrieval and
interpretation in order to get knowledge and to deduce new facts
(Figure 1).

DES knowledgebases are integrated resource thats consists of
a collection of relevant scientific literature and data
from various bioinformatics sources, with an engine that can reason
about this data and use built-in logic to derive new facts and suggest
hypotheses.
